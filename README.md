## Summary
If you've seen Moneyball or like sports then you know we can't measure everything via our eyes. We aim to measure unique employee value using KPIs in a methodology similar to SABRmetrics in baseball or advanced stats in basketball.
## Goals
Develop a catalog of advanced metrics along with how to measure them to assist employers in finding the value in their employees.
