# Weighted Ticket Resolution
WTR=∑(Tickets Resolved×Complexity Weight)
## Summary
Our first release is a formula designed to capture the difficulty that comes with each priority level, and multiply it by the total resolutions to get a score measuring a techs ability to seek out and accomplish difficult tickets.
## Abstract
"Technicians don't grow unless they're challenged. Some technicians will naturally seek out a challenge, but this prevents others from being given an opportunity to rise up and learn."

Traditional IT performance metrics often fail to account for the complexity and strategic value of work completed. By treating all tickets equally, organizations risk rewarding volume over impact and stifling growth. This document introduces Weighted Ticket Resolution (WTR), a framework that quantifies the difficulty and importance of tasks to fairly evaluate technician performance. Like SABRmetrics in baseball, WTR shifts the focus from superficial metrics (e.g., "tickets resolved") to nuanced, data-driven insights that reflect true contribution and potential.
