# Weighted Real Technician Value (WRTV)

## Abstract
Weighted Real Technician Value (WRTV) enhances the standard RTV metric by applying a more precise scaling factor that better aligns with organizational benchmarks and performance expectations. This refined calculation provides greater sensitivity to performance variations and creates a more nuanced evaluation framework for technician assessment.

## Introduction
While the standard RTV provides a solid foundation for technician evaluation, the Weighted RTV introduces a calibrated scaling factor that improves metric sensitivity and interpretability across different performance levels and organizational contexts.

WRTV addresses advanced measurement needs by:
* Applying a precise scaling coefficient (0.1058) derived from organizational data analysis
* Enhancing the differentiation between performance tiers
* Aligning more accurately with business impact and value creation

## Methodology

### 1.) Component Integration
Like the standard RTV, WRTV combines:
* **Agent Time Score (ATS)**: Measures response and resolution time efficiency
* **Weighted Ticket Volume by Complexity**: Accounts for the number and difficulty of tickets handled with appropriate complexity weights

### 2.) Ticket Complexity Weighting
Tickets are weighted according to their complexity level:
* Low Complexity Tickets: × 0.1
* Medium Complexity Tickets: × 0.2
* High Complexity Tickets: × 0.3
* Urgent Complexity Tickets: × 0.4

### 3.) WRTV Formula
**WRTV = ((Agent Time Score * (((Low Ticket × 0.1) + (Medium Ticket × 0.2)) + (High Ticket × 0.3)) + (Urgent Ticket × 0.4))) * 0.1058)**

The formula:
- Applies complexity weights to each ticket category
- Multiplies the Agent Time Score by the total weighted ticket value
- Applies the precision scaling factor (0.1058) for enhanced calibration

Example:
Technician A has:
- Agent Time Score: 95
- Low Tickets: 20
- Medium Tickets: 10
- High Tickets: 5
- Urgent Tickets: 2

WRTV = ((95 * (((20 × 0.1) + (10 × 0.2)) + (5 × 0.3)) + (2 × 0.4))) * 0.1058)
     = ((95 * (((2) + (2)) + (1.5)) + (0.8))) * 0.1058)
     = ((95 * ((4) + (1.5)) + (0.8))) * 0.1058)
     = ((95 * ((5.5) + (0.8))) * 0.1058)
     = ((95 * (6.3)) * 0.1058)
     = (598.5 * 0.1058)
     = 63.32

### 4.) Scaling Factor Rationale
The 0.1058 coefficient was determined through:
- Analysis of historical performance data
- Correlation with business outcomes and customer satisfaction
- Calibration to create meaningful separation between performance tiers
- Alignment with organizational value metrics

## Score Range
* 80+ WRTV = Exceptional performer delivering transformative value
* 60-79 WRTV = High-impact technician consistently exceeding expectations
* 40-59 WRTV = Strong contributor reliably meeting all performance targets
* 20-39 WRTV = Developing technician with specific improvement areas
* <20 WRTV = Requires structured performance improvement plan

## Implementation Benefits
* **Enhanced Precision**: More accurately reflects the true value contribution differences
* **Better Differentiation**: Creates clearer separation between performance levels
* **Organizational Alignment**: Calibrated to reflect actual business impact
* **Improved Incentive Structure**: Provides more meaningful targets for performance incentives

## Usage Guidelines
* WRTV should be calculated on a consistent time period (weekly or monthly) for fair comparison
* The scaling factor (0.1058) should be periodically reviewed and recalibrated based on organizational changes
* Consider using percentile rankings alongside absolute WRTV scores for context
* Implement a formal review process for technicians whose WRTV falls below expected thresholds
* Use WRTV trends over time to identify improvement or decline in individual performance
