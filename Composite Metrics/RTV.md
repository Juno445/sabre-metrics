# Real Technician Value (RTV)

## Abstract
Real Technician Value (RTV) provides a comprehensive evaluation of technician performance by combining time efficiency with ticket complexity handling. This holistic metric balances speed, quality, and the ability to tackle challenges of varying difficulty, offering a more accurate representation of a technician's true value to the organization.

## Introduction
IT service desk performance traditionally suffers from siloed metrics that fail to capture the complete picture of technician contribution. Some technicians excel at speed but avoid complex tickets, while others tackle challenging issues but take longer to resolve them.

RTV addresses this challenge by:
* Integrating time efficiency (Agent Time Score) with ticket complexity handling
* Weighting performance based on both quantity and difficulty of tickets resolved
* Creating a single, balanced metric that reflects true operational value

## Methodology

### 1.) Component Integration
RTV combines two key performance dimensions:
* **Agent Time Score (ATS)**: Measures response and resolution time efficiency
* **Ticket Volume by Complexity**: Accounts for the number and difficulty of tickets handled

### 2.) RTV Formula
**RTV = ((Agent Time Score * (((Low Ticket + Medium Ticket) + High Ticket) + Urgent Ticket)) * 0.01)**

The formula:
- Multiplies the Agent Time Score by the total weighted ticket count
- Applies a scaling factor (0.01) for readability and practical interpretation

Example:
Technician A has:
- Agent Time Score: 95
- Low Tickets: 20
- Medium Tickets: 10
- High Tickets: 5
- Urgent Tickets: 2

RTV = ((95 * (((20 + 10) + 5) + 2)) * 0.01)
    = ((95 * ((30 + 5) + 2)) * 0.01)
    = ((95 * (35 + 2)) * 0.01)
    = ((95 * 37) * 0.01)
    = (3515 * 0.01)
    = 35.15

### 3.) Interpretation
RTV provides a balanced view that rewards both:
- Efficiency in handling tickets (through the ATS component)
- Willingness to take on tickets of all complexity levels (through the ticket count component)

## Score Range
* 40+ RTV = Elite performer delivering exceptional value across all dimensions
* 30-39 RTV = High-value technician with strong overall performance
* 20-29 RTV = Solid contributor meeting expectations
* 10-19 RTV = Developing technician with improvement opportunities
* <10 RTV = Requires significant performance improvement and coaching

## Implementation Benefits
* **Balanced Evaluation**: Prevents gaming the system by focusing solely on speed or volume
* **Growth Encouragement**: Rewards technicians for taking on challenging tickets
* **Comprehensive Assessment**: Captures both efficiency and effectiveness dimensions
* **Fair Comparison**: Allows for meaningful comparison between technicians with different workloads

## Usage Guidelines
* RTV should be calculated on a consistent time period (weekly or monthly) for fair comparison
* Consider team averages and historical trends when interpreting individual RTV scores
* Use RTV alongside qualitative assessments for performance reviews and coaching
* Periodically review the formula weights to ensure alignment with organizational priorities
