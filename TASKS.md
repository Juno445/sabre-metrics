# Improvement Tasks for Sabre-Metrics

This document outlines key tasks to address the weaknesses identified in the repository.

## 1. Clarify Licensing
- Decide whether the project is MIT or GPL.
- Update either `LICENSE` or the README so both reference the same license text.

## 2. Professionalize Documentation
- Remove casual or humorous language from metric descriptions (e.g., "This is a god amongst men" in `Weighted vs Group/WTCS.md`).
- Correct typos such as "Complexty".
- Ensure consistent formatting across all Markdown files.

## 3. Expand Implementation Examples
- Provide concrete examples for calculating each metric (SQL snippets, sample scripts, or datasets).
- Document data pipelines or reporting steps to show real-world usage.

## 4. Standardize Metric Document Structure
- Adopt a common template for each metric (overview, formula, data requirements, example, score range).
- Apply this structure across all files under `Composite Metrics/` and `Weighted vs Group/`.

## 5. Add Diagrams or Workflows
- Include diagrams illustrating how metrics integrate with ITSM tools and reporting dashboards.
- Add these visuals to the README or relevant metric files.

By completing these tasks, the project will present a clearer, more professional, and actionable framework for evaluating IT support performance.
